# ROS 2 Workspace

Personal workspace to refresh and deepen my ROS 2 skills while following **_Mastering ROS 2 for Robotics Programming_**.  
I use this repo to rebuild foundations, collect examples, and practice advanced features.

---

## ðŸ“š Purpose / Goals

- Revisit core ROS 2 concepts: nodes, topics, services, actions
- Practice packaging, build systems, parameters, and launch files
- Explore lifecycle nodes, composition, and integrations (e.g., ROS 2 + simulation)




## ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgments

Exercises and structure inspired by _Mastering ROS 2 for Robotics Programming_.
