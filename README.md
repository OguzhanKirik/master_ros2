# ROS 2 Workspace

This repository is my personal workspace while I refresh and strengthen my ROS 2 skillset.  
I’m following along with the book **_Mastering ROS 2 for Robotics Programming_** to rebuild my foundations and practice key concepts.

---

## 📚 Purpose

- Revisit core ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics, services, actions).
- Practice building and organizing packages in a real workspace.
- Explore advanced features such as lifecycle management, launch files, and integrations.

## 🗂 Workspace Structure


Only the `src/` directory is version-controlled. Everything else is auto-generated by `colcon build` and ignored via `.gitignore`.

---

## ⚙️ Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url> ros2_ws
cd ros2_ws
